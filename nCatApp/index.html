              <p>Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.
               It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Ancient Egypt,
               as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.</p>

                <p id = 'fText'>The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat,
                was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus,
                dating to about 9,200 to 9,500 years before present.
                As there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic
                village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern
                mainland.</p>
